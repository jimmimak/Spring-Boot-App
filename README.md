This project concerns the implementation of a conference management system. In order to achieve this, the Spring Boot framework was used, which is suitable for developing RESTful services and the Maven tool for managing dependencies, since the language chosen for the 
backend implementation is Java. The system functions that were implemented was the registration of a user in the system, the login of a user in the system, the utilization of the system by a user as a guest and the search of conferences by the guest.
